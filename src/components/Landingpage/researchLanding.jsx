                        This course is about dealing with uncertainty that appears in
                        virtually all areas of data science and computer science. This will
                        be accomplished with tools and techniques for its measurement,
                        description, evaluation, and ultimately making decisions under
                        uncertainty.

                    <p>
                        The course will approach these goals using a three-fold approach,
                        namely problem, theory, and prototype (PTP). We will motivate major
                        topics by discussing a problem. The purpose of discussion of the
                        problem is to give context behind why a particular supporting topic
                        in probability was developed or what it is intended to address. The
                        problem will be followed by theory. This concerns rigorous
                        mathematical definition and tools for their manipulation in order to
                        address the problem. Emphasis will be placed on approaches that are
                        amenable to implementation. Finally, theory will be followed by
                        prototype. The purpose of the prototype aspect of the course is to
                        train students in the development of models that serve a useful
                        purpose.

                    <p>Data in the 21st Century draws many parallels to Oil in the 18th Century, while its use is increasing, its applications and full utility remain largely untapped. While limited in usefulness in its raw form, substantial value arises from its refining, that is the derivative forms from its processing, mixture with other components, and its transformation. Such processes on Data are purposed with gaining insights, nuggets of information not directly observable. One finds achievement of efficiencies engendered by the refining of data ranging broadly across diverse domains from transportation and commerce to entertainment and healthcare. More recently, governments have employed data to improve apportionment of funds and delivery of critical services. An organizationâ€™s ability to employ data and use it to generate insights enables better decision-making.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In this course, we cover introductory concepts purposed with building student background in the Data Science process, that is posing questions, gathering data, developing analyses, and articulating data-informed decisions. We also introduce students to entry-level computational tools and methods purposed with extracting insights from data as we survey the Data Science process and consider its impact. Students will also be challenged to consider issues concerning privacy, bias, and ethics surrounding data and crafting data-informed decisions. A goal of the course is to expose students to examples from varied domains.</p>

                    <p>Math 113 is an introduction to Sports Analytics, a rapidly growing discipline. The course focuses primarily on the NBA and MLB, the pro basketball and baseball leagues in the U.S. We will also include lecture topics on marathon running and womenâ€™s professional tennis, and students may pursue any sport in their final project. Our approach will be to understand recently available advanced statistics and to build simple models using R software. With this experience, we will make data-driven evaluations and predictions in lectures and in projects. A few additional topics will be presented such as player development, in-game strategy, team building, and the draft. The modeling techniques and software learned in this course are general ones and could be applied to many other fields such as medicine, politics, business, and science.</p>
